    "What should I do if I drop my phone in water?": "If you drop your phone in water, do not attempt to charge it. Turn your phone off if it is still on. Do not put it in rice as it will not do anything other than dry the exterior of the phone, the internals may still contain water. Instead, take it to Fixit Fast Repairs or your closest repair shop immediately to allow them to open the device up, unplug the battery, and remove any water residue left.
